    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 100 (3.5 inch square) wonton wrappers</li>
        <li> 1 ¾ pounds ground pork</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
        <li> 4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onion</li>
        <li> 4 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li> 3 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
        <li> 1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li> 5 cups finely shredded Chinese cabbage</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>DIRECTIONS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> In a large bowl, combine the pork, ginger, garlic, green onion, soy sauce, sesame oil, egg and cabbage. Stir until well mixed.</li>
        <li> Place 1 heaping teaspoon of pork filling onto each wonton skin. Moisten edges with water and fold edges over to form a triangle shape. Roll edges slightly to seal in filling. Set dumplings aside on a lightly floured surface until ready to cook.</li>
        <li> Arrange dumplings in a covered bamboo or metal steamer so they don't touch to prevent them from sticking together; steam for 15 minutes, or until pork is cooked through.</li>
        
    </ol>
